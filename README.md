# About this project
This project contains my solutions position the exercises of the lecture Mobile Robots at the University of Applied Sciences Kempten in the summer term 2021 by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jürgen Brauer.

This project goes beyond the scope of the exercises of this lecture and includes e.g. topics from the lecture Multimodal Sensor Systems.

Parts of this project are based on the solutions of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jürgen Brauer. These can be found here: https://github.com/juebrauer (especially https://github.com/juebrauer/teaching_mobile_robots)
